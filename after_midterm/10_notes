Chapter 10: Peer-to-Peer
========================

No single point for copyright liability, ...
Fully decentralized, self-organizing

Hard to attack and spread out the load

Store large collections of immutable data
When you allow changes, then you have to figure out how to get the latest version

JJ: Can have a mix of P2P and a admin server for indexing plus tracking updates
    Plague model could help with updates too
        either for spreading updates
        or competing updates, where only the strongest survives
