The exam description slides will be posted on blackboard

most questions will be a paragraph or 2 of analysis

first skim through slides

Remote vs local call
Parallel vs distributed


Skim Ch1

Ch 2: System Models
    How did we describe systems in these different ways:
    - Physical Models
    - ...2 other models on slide

Ch 14: Time and Global States
    will fill in a grid as shown in class with happen-before logic 
    -Logical TIme and Logical Clocks
    -Vector time (auxiliary material)
    -Cuts

    NOT TESTING Lattices

Ch 15: Coordination and Agreement
    -Distr

    Don't need a complete alg, but maybe summary of approach

Ch 4: IPC
    Will never have you code up middleware on a test
    but need a concrete feel of the nuts & bolts
    kind of things you need to handle at the socket level, esp. that handled by middleware

    Network virtualization: overlay networks
    Do they support or contradict the end-to-end model?
    NOT TESTING MPI

Ch 5:
    Request/call semantics (at least once, at most once, ...) how they add up


    NOT TESTING Java RMI (an example but don't need to know details of it

Know nuts and bolts of CORBA

The basics of the last thing on the slides

His exams tend to go long. He likes median scores (so expecting to curve)
That lets you skip over stuff you might not know down pat
About 10 pages


End-to-End paper only for 564 students (don't need to read, should someday)

Not testable but interesting and useful:

Towards Quality of Service in Distributed Systems with AOP and QoS Meta-Data

QoS = Quality of Service

IDL: business logic (what)
QoS: how to do the what
